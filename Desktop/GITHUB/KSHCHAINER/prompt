OK, at my workplace I have to map KSH scripts. I have over 2k 
  sript to be analyzed, the ultimate goal is that I need to know 
  out from these scripts whether it calls other KSH script/s (you
   may have multiple level of calls so file1->file2->file3 ect). 
  Also I need to be able to map any occurences of .ctl file these
   are used by sqlload within ksh script (I have a separate 
  folder with them). Whats more I need to be able to correlate 
  perticular script with any call of pl/sql procedure which 
  regular layout look select 
  schema.pk_xyz.actual_procedure/functions(params). Before 
  codding tell me what you understand and whats ur suggestion. I 
  would like to be able also to ilustrate these dependencies. 
  When it comes to dependecies itself, for any given ksh script, 
  I need to be able to see, if it was called by other ksh script 
  so we need forward looking and backwards looking algorithm
